<h2 id=about>About: </h2>    

Welcome to the Rich Text Editor project! 

This application is designed to provide a simple interface for text editing tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary goal is to serve as a showcase of my skills while I`m learning and experimenting with development tools.

A¬†rich text editor¬†is an interface or input field for text editing, that includes advanced styling options like heading levels,¬†bold,¬†italic, bullet points,¬†font typefaces, and¬†text size. You can also embed images, hyperlinks, and other rich media (such as videos) into a rich text editor.

The application runs online via GitHub pages, and you can check out the functions. It has a lot of room for improvement, so as I learn new skills and abilities, I will update and improve the application, and I plan to publish it as an API.

Initially, I was going to make the application with Python and TKinter; however, I decided to change the tools in order to run and deploy it online. That was my first challenge. Later I had another problem: highlight the button as it was clicked, after some research I managed to understand how the focus and active property in CSS works. Futhermore I have never studied Javascript before, so I had to learn functions, listeners and get elements etc. In the end I expected to finish the project in 1 week, and took me 1 month to actually finish it.

Through this project, I not only achieved my initial goal of creating a rich text editor but also acquired valuable insights, overcoming challenges that expanded my proficiency in both CSS and JavaScript. This journey stands as a testament to the iterative nature of development and the continuous growth.
